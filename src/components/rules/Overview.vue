      Games will start with six balls on the court with one off-color ball being
      the designated burden ball.
    </li>
    <li>
      Opening rush: Players must start completely behind the back line at the
      beginning of the game. A ball may not be thrown until both feet have
      cleared the attack line.
    </li>
    <li>
      Play continues until one team is eliminated, the refs call a pause in
      gameplay, or until the round timer sounds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Balls are live until they touch the floor, ceiling, walls, a dead ball or
      an opponent’s live ball.
    </li>
    <ul class="pl-5">
      <li>
        Example: Player A throws and hits Player B, and the ball bounces back to
        Player A or any other player on Player A’s team, the ball is
        automatically dead as soon as one of those players touch the ball.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Multiple outs: Each live ball can get more than one player out.</li>
    <li>
      Deflected catches: If a ball hits you or your ball and a teammate catches
      it before it becomes dead, it is considered a catch. You are safe, the
      person who threw the ball is out, and a player from your team may come
      back in.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hard lines: It is okay for players to step on boundary lines, but if a
      player steps any further over a sideline or beyond the neutral zone, that
      player is out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ball count: The team with the majority of balls (or burden if the count is
      equal) has ten seconds to relinquish that burden. If the ball majority is
      not released, the burdened team must give up all balls.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Queue: The first player eliminated is the first to come back into a
      game if there is a catch and they are completely out of bounds. If more
      than one player or the wrong player steps in bounds they are out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Headshots are illegal. When the target is either standing or in an
      athletic position. If the target is crouching or jumping the hit will not
      be deemed a headshot.
    </li>
    <li>
      Going out: If a player has possession of a ball when they are out, they
      may roll that ball to their teammates. An out player cannot be caught back
      in until they are completely out of bounds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Players are to play by the honor system. If in doubt, a player should call
      themselves out.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a rule is not clarified please consult with the organizers rather than
      falling back to another ruleset.
