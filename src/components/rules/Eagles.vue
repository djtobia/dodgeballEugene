      Eagles are when a player jumps from the neutral zone into the opponentâ€™s side of
      the court to make a throw. If their throw was successful in getting someone out,
      the thrower is still alive but must return to their side immediately.
    </li>
    <li>That player is vulnerable until they return to their side of the court, and can be hit by opponents.</li>
    <li>The eagler is allowed to dodge, but cannot go out of bounds or touch other players.</li>
    <li>
      They cannot bring balls back to their side when returning from a successful eagle, but are not out if
      they touch a dead ball.
    </li>
    <li>
      If they make it back to their side before getting hit by an opposing
      player's ball, they are still a live player and can continue playing.
    </li>
    <li>A player that is hit mid-eagle is out as soon as they are hit.</li>
    <li>A ball thrown by the eagler is only valid if thrown before they were hit.</li>
    <li>
      If an eagling player initiates contact with an opposing player, they are out. If an opposing player
      initiates contact with the eagler, the opposing player is out, and the eagler gets a safe return to
      their side.
    </li>
