      Only players (and on exception center refs) may grab balls in the
      neutral zone.

      Center refs do their absolute best to not interact with stray dodgeballs.
      The ONLY exception a center ref can touch a ball is if it ends up in the
      neutral zone and on the side of a team that does NOT yet have a
      player out. In this case they put the ball at the closest point to the
      neutral zone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Line refs try their best to help the side theyâ€™re on. They do not touch
      dodgeballs in the neutral zone.
    </li>
