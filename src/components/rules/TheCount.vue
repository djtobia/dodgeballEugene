      The ten-second count is how we keep the game moving. When a team possesses
      a majority of the balls (or the burden ball in case of a tie), the burden is on them to
      throw enough balls to drop below that majority within ten seconds. Once that
      occurs, the count resets.
    </li>
    <li>
      The team need only throw enough balls to drop below the majority as achieved
      when the count started. Additional balls collected during the count do not increase
      the number of required throws during this count. The burden ball decides which
      team is “burdened” to throw in case of a tie (3 balls on each side).
    </li>
    <li>
      If the required number of balls or burden ball are not thrown within ten seconds,
      the ref will stop play and award all of the balls to the other side.
      When there is only one player remaining on a team, that player will still need to
      throw the required amount of balls to drop below the majority before the ten
      second count expires.
    </li>
    <li>
      Intentionally throwing a ball out of bounds not towards an opposing player
      (bouncing off of high ceiling/basketball rims as well) is considered a delay of game.
      The ref will stop play and award the non-throwing team the ball.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reffing the 10 second count is hard. We recommend one ref be dedicated to this.
      Use your arms to denote which side currently has the burden and start the count
      by declaring how many balls they need to throw. A silent count is fine but when the
      count gets down to five seconds make sure you’re loud enough for both teams to
      hear. On a count down, if you are able to begin the word “zero” without the
      requisite balls being thrown, stop play immediately, redistribute balls, and restart
      both teams from behind the back line.
