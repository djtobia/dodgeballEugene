      There should be a minimum of four referees and a maximum amount of six. One
      center ref should handle ball count while the other does countdown and is
      watching for outs, catches, line violations, etc. Both line refs are watching the
      back/sidelines and are helping that team retrieve rogue balls.

    <li>A game may NOT start until there are four refs on the court! Captains MUST ref.</li>

      Honour System Officiating: It is ultimately up to the players to enforce and uphold
      the rules of dodgeball when playing or refereeing. Dodgeball relies on the honour
      system, in which officiating is determined more between players and less from the
      referees

      If there is a controversial play, the referees will make the final call. They have the
      right to stop a game and discuss the incident before proceeding. In respect for the
      game and fellow players, there is absolutely no protesting allowed. All players
      (including captains) must grab balls in their possession and step behind the back
      line of the court while the referees discuss a decision. A referee may ask both
      captains to join the discussion to make clarifications. The refs will resume play
      after a decision has been made and players/refs are back in position. However, we
      encourage players to discuss and clarify any plays in a respectful manner with
      referees <span class="text-decoration-underline">after the match is over</span>.
