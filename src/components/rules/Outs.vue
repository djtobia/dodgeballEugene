    <li>If you get hit, you’re out. Easy right? Well, there are tricky some grey areas.</li>
    <li>A player is considered out if they are contacted by a live ball thrown by the opposite team and it becomes dead.</li>
    <li>Clothing: Uniforms and accessories are considered part of a player’s body.

          This includes hats. If you are wearing a hat and the brim gets hit by a ball that would normally not strike the players head, this is an out. For headshot clarification, see the “Headshots” section.

      Hit etiquette: If a player is hit, they may pass balls under their control
      to their teammates, raise their arm to signal that they are out, and
      leave the court immediately without disrupting play.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once a player is out, if they make contact with a ball not under their
      possession to pass to teammates that ball will be considered dead
      and given to the opposing team.
    </li>
    <li>“If in doubt, you’re out!” If you are not sure if you were hit or safe, go out.</li>
    <li>
      A player is out only once the live ball has hit a dead surface. This
      means that the player may throw or catch other balls until the original
      ball is dead and they are officially out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Trap: When a live ball hits between a players foot and the ground at
      the same time. This is considered an out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Too close to call: If a player takes a headshot while standing or in athletic pose and in the
      same volley gets hit out the out is negated. If they take the headshot and catch a ball the catch
      is still valid and thrower of the head shot is out.
