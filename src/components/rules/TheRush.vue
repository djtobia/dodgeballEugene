    <li>On the initial rush, you may only touch the balls on the right side of the court.</li>
    <li>Balls must be checked behind the attack line with both feet touching the ground before they are considered live.</li>
    <li>After all of your own balls have been checked you may grab the remaining balls on the center line if the other team did not get theirs.</li>
    <li>Only during the opening rush may you cross the center line.</li>
