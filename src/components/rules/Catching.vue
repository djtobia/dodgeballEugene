      If a player catches a ball thrown by an opponent, the thrower is out
      and one player returns to the catcher’s side from the queue. in the
      order of first out, first in.
    </li>
    <li>
      A catch is when a player retains control of a ball thrown by an
      opponent and must land with both feet in bounds.
    </li>
    <li>
      When a player is caught back into the game, that player must enter
      from the back of the court or up to halfway to the center from the
      sidelines.
    </li>
    <li>Returning players are live as soon as both feet are inbounds.</li>
    <li>
      If a teammate catches a ball that is deflected off another teammate’s
      body it is considered a catch. The teammate is saved, the thrower is
      out, and an out player on that team may come back into the game.
    </li>
    <li>
      Catches from blocks: It is considered a catch if an opponent’s ball hits
      a blocking ball and is caught by the blocker’s teammate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Catching balls going out of bounds (NFL rule): Player must be in
      control (see <router-link to="/glossary#control">Glossary</router-link>) of the ball before going out of bounds, with
      both feet touching in bounds for a catch to be valid. The catch counts
      and the player may step back inbounds during this time.
    </li>
    <li>
      A catch is only completed if both feet are touch the ground
      inbounds. A ball that hits a player who is making a catch midair and
      dies before that player reaches the ground results in no catch and that
      player is out.
    </li>
    <li>
      If there is a catch and neither team knows who was caught the referee
      will pause the game and choose one player from the throwing side to
      come off the court.
    </li>
    <li>
      Too close to call: If a player is hit out but makes a catch within the
      same volley, the player is out, but the catch counts. See the definition
      of <router-link to="/glossary#volley">volley</router-link>.
